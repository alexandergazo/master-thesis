		our knowledge, no research has been conducted for West Slavic languages.
		In this paper, we present datasets for Czech, Polish, and Slovak. We also ran initial experiments which set a baseline for further research into this area.}

The analytical discussion of the method is included to demonstrate its convergence behavior. As a matter of fact, it is proven that the suggested scheme possesses tenth order of convergence. Finally, its performance is illustrated by numerical examples on different matrices.},

Annotating data for this task involves the creation of supporting and refuting claims over a set of evidence. Automatic annotation processes often leave superficial patterns in data, which learning systems can detect instead of performing the underlying task. Humans also can leave these superficial patterns, either voluntarily or involuntarily (due to e.g. fatigue). The two measures introduced attempt to detect the impact of these superficial patterns. One is a new information-theoretic and distributionality based measure, \textit{DCI}; and the other an extension of neural probing work over the ARCT task, \textit{utility}. We demonstrate these measures over a recent major dataset, that from the English FEVER task in 2019.",

There were also various scripts and programs for generating query terms, running batches of trials and performing evaluation. The main code is written in C, with additional material in awk and perl. The evaluation program is from Chris Buckley at Cornell.},
